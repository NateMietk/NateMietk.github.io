# Biography

I am an ecologist and remote sensing specialist interested in forest dynamics, disturbance interactions, and wildfire, at multiple scales.  My current research links wildfire ignition to the costs, consequences of human-started wildfire across the contiguous USA, specifically in and around the wildland-urban interface (WUI). 

  My research leverages field based data collection, remotely sensed image analysis, and modeling procedures to understand current and future wildfire at the local, regional, and sub-continental level.  Prior research has explored the complex interactions between forest disturbance, varying climatic conditions, and their influence on the abundance of forest fuels and fire behavior in subalpine ecosystems in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, western North America, and the Swiss Alps.
