# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The number of wildfires has increased in the U.S. since 1970. Simultaneously, more homes have been built in areas that meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation, creating zones known as the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Communities in these areas are both at risk of wildfire danger and thought to be the primary cause of wildfire ignitions across the U.S. We explored the consequences (fire frequency, burned area, seasonality) and costs (suppression costs, homes destroyed, lives lost) of human vs. lightning-started wildfires, along a gradient from the WUI to wildland areas across the conterminous U.S. (2001-2015). This study illustrates how the WUI, which accounts for only a small portion of U.S. land area (13%), acts as a major source of fires, almost exclusively human-started. WUI fires, in turn, account for a disproportionate number of structures and lives lost, suppression costs, and expand to burn large areas of surrounding wildland. In the WUI, 96% of wildfires started by people, and an average of 0.11% (range: 0.06 - 0.17%), or 867 km2, burned every year. Human-started wildfires originating in the WUI alone resulted \$397 million in suppression costs, 4,717 structures lost, and 20 lives lost. While overall, human-caused wildfires in all lands accounted for 34% of all fire suppression costs ($3.4 billion), 86% (n = 11,226) structures lost, and 90 lives lost. Nearly 40% of all wildfires between 2001-2015 started in the WUI, making these areas a high-priority for policy and management aimed at reducing human ignitions and promoting resilience to future fires."
