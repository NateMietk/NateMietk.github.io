title = "What is the relative importance of mountain pine beetle outbreaks versus antecedent climatic variability on the occurrence of large wildfires in the western U.S.?"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Despite widespread concern that mountain pine beetle outbreaks lead to unprecedented increases in wildfire activity, here we demonstrated minimal effects of these pre-fire disturbances on subsequent fire occurrence. Instead, occurrence of large wildfires across the western US has been driven by extreme weather (e.g., hot, dry conditions)."
